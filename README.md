# NarrativeX

NarrativeX is an image-first AI Story Video Studio for turning flexible-length stories into consistent, reviewed long-form videos and Short/Reel exports.

## Repository map

| Area | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/backend-service` | Spring Boot modular monolith, ownership, domain state, jobs and cost authority |
| `app/ai-worker` | Python AI/media worker, provider ports, QA, TTS and FFmpeg orchestration |
| `app/frontend-web` | Next.js/TypeScript storyboard, review, cost and notification UI |
| `documentation` | Product, domain, architecture, workflows, codebase notes and ADRs |
| `contracts` | Versioned backend ↔ worker payload contracts |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO dependencies |

## Start local dependencies

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

Then follow the module READMEs and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for backend, worker, and frontend checks.

## Product guardrails

V1.7 is not a fixed-duration or fixed-image-count generator. Planning uses semantic scene boundaries, narration timing, complexity, asset reuse, delta scope, provider capability, and cost reservation. Character identity is versioned and reviewed; external provider outcomes are durable and reconciled; chapter continuation, notifications, entitlement, trust & safety, rights/consent, abuse and privacy gates are part of the production baseline.

The source of truth for this baseline is the project specification named in `AGENTS.md`.
